# Description
>Mistings are [allomancers](https://mistborn.fandom.com/wiki/Allomancy "Allomancy") who can use only one of the [Allomantic metals](https://mistborn.fandom.com/wiki/Allomantic_Table_of_Metals "Allomantic Table of Metals"). All Mistings in the [Final Empire](https://mistborn.fandom.com/wiki/Final_Empire "Final Empire") are descended from individuals who ingested [lerasium](https://mistborn.fandom.com/wiki/Lerasium "Lerasium") around one thousand years before the empire's fall. The powers granted to these original [[quartz/content/MISTBORN/Societal Roles/Mistborn|Mistborn]] were far more potent and varied. The ability to use allomancy was passed down genetically, but over time the power became diluted. Eventually, Mistings began to appear and full Mistborn became very rare.
