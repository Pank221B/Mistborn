# Description 
>While not technically slaves, because by law they are not the property of their masters, in practice they are treated like cattle and given about as much respect. The skaa are the beaten down, oppressed working class, and because of this many are timid in regards to the nobles. Skaa generally keep to themselves, and in the cities, a large number turn to a life of crime to sustain themselves.

>Those who are not criminals are worked to near death in some situations by their masters. Plantation skaa were especially brutalized and often did not live as long as their city counterparts as they were killed if they were unable to work. Only very skilled skaa were able to have a trade and work as a craftsman, although they were still underpaid and looked down upon by the nobility

>Skaa maintain a fear of the evening [[Mist]] due to folklore and misinformation spread by the nobles, believing those who go out into the mists are killed and turn into [mistwraiths](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mistwraith "Mistwraith").[[5]](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Skaa#cite_note-The_Final_Empire-prologue-chapter-5)

>Skaa living in the outer dominances, far from the Central Dominance, are allowed to own lands and become rich, but the Lord Ruler does not allow this to become publicly known
